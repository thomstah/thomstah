## Hi there 👋

I'm Thommy, a software engineering undergraduate studying at the University of Texas at Arlington and am located in the DFW area!

My specialty comes in web development, specifically in the frontend — React, JavaScript/TypeScript, Tailwind, and other fancy stuff — but I'm also into fullstack development.
